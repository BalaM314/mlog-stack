# MLOG Stack

A sequel to [mlogx](https://github.com/BalaM314/mlogx).

Aims to support stack allocation, recursive function calls, and C-style expressions, emitting assembly-like MLOG.

Work in progress.

## Roadmap

* Lexer: done
* Parser: done
* Codegen: working, except for functions
* Optimization: not yet started, but the codegen does some things that could be considered optimizations
